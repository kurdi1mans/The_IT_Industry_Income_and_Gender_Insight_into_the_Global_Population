## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Programmers from around the world do similar things. Indeed, the software industry is one of few industries where the skill set and knowledge is very, for the lack of a better word, Standardized. The average web developer in China is very likely to be doing the same kind of work a developer in Canada is doing.

Since we have this great similarity of the work being done, it would be imperative to wounder about whether these individuals are paid equally. Moreover, it is also of interest to know if there are pay gaps, over-representation, or any other form of dissimilarity across the global programmers population.

In this article, Iâ€™ll be using the StackOverflow survey (check it out here) of programmers from the year 2018 along with Country Population and GDP per Capita (here and here) to investigate a couple of questions in an attempt to shed some light on these dissimilarities:

- Question 1: Assuming that Stackoverflow users are representative of the whole world population, Are there any contries over-represented or under-represented in the programmers dataset?
- Question 2: What is the gender representation in the workforce per country?
- Question 3: Can we find a correlation between countries where programmers have lower income and contries were the whole economy has a lower GDP per captial?
- Question 4: What are the most infulencial dimensions in predicting an individuals income?

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You will only need the Jupyter Notebook Server (5.7.8) running with Python3 (Developed with Python 3.7.3) to run this project (namely the The_IT_Industry_Income_and_Gender_Insight_into_the_Global_Population.ipynb file).

The notebook itself requires some packages to be installed: pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, and the sklearn python library. These are included by default with a standard Jupyter Notebook installation through Anaconda which can be downloaded through https://www.anaconda.com/

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The project is simply the The_IT_Industry_Income_and_Gender_Insight_into_the_Global_Population.ipynb file. The file itself is utilizing three datasets for the analysis. These datasets cannot be uploaded to the Github repositroy due to size restrictions. However, you still can download them yourself through the links below.

- StackOverflow Survey data for the year 2018 (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)
- World Bank Population data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
- World Bank GDP per Capita data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD)

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The final results from the analysis are also available in the notebook file. Alternatively, you can directly jump to the final results by reading this article on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@kurdi1mans/the-it-industry-income-and-gender-insight-into-the-global-population-c4ddd9d98c99)
